			Hi, Iâ€™m a Manan Shah, doing web development since 2011 and occassionally did some mobile app
			development too, most of the time is spent on working at my day job which is in <b>ReactJs</b>
			as a frontend specialist. I love to learn new things and hopefully this blog will help me to document
			my learning journey and experiences share with you all.
